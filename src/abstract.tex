The HistFactory p.d.f. template is per-se independent of its implementation in ROOT and it is useful to be able to run statistical analysis outside of the ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework.
\pyhf{} is a pure-Python implementation of that statistical model for multi-bin histogram-based analysis and its interval estimation is based on the asymptotic formulas of ``Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics''.
\pyhf{} supports modern computational graph libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX in order to make use of features such as auto-differentiation and GPU acceleration.
In addition, \pyhf{}'s JSON serialization specification for HistFactory models has been used to publish 23 full probability models from published ATLAS collaboration analyses to HEPData.
